### What is this repository for? ###
Some of my own custom libs that I use in some C/C++ projects.

### Contents ###
See .h files for each lib description.<br>
I plan to put a summary in here in the future.

### Usage ###
Library files are purely .h files that I include in other projects. <br>
The test directory has some example usage.

### Building ###
The test directory has some examples that can built to see the library in action.<br>
To build and run, execute the corresponding shell script in test/.<br>
(e.g.: ./make_tokenizer_test.sh)

### Warning! ###
**Work in progress**<br>
I use this for my own projects and I still am developing it. It is not ready for others to use!<br>
I just needed somewhere to store this repository that wasn't on my local computer.<br>
